Introduction:

This GitHub repository is dedicated to an in-depth traffic analysis focusing on crash rates, speed, and volume data. The project employs various data processing techniques, data visualization, and statistics to present a comprehensive understanding of traffic conditions.

Key Highlights:

1. This Jupyter notebook is dedicated to data cleaning and preparation. It includes the conversion of time formats, rounding of mile markers, and the calculation of crash index values.

2. This notebook is loaded with various types of data visualizations such as histograms and heatmaps, providing a visual representation of crash rates and speeds across different time frames.

3. This notebook provides aggregated views of data, such as average speed and volume, and performs statistical analysis to understand the variability in the data.

Disclaimer - Data Security and Sources:

Data Sources: The data used in this study, obtained from the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) crash data website and supplemented with INRIX API speed data.
Data Access: Due to data integrity and privacy concerns, the raw data is not available in this repository. However, you may request access to the data from the Travel Demand Modeling Group at the Virginia Department of Transportation.
